        <p>Ecuadorian culture is a multi-ethnic mosaic that blends Indigenous, European, and African heritages across its diverse regional landscapes. A majority of the population identifies as Mestizo, but significant indigenous groups (like the Kichwa and Shuar) and Afro-Ecuadorian communities maintain distinct traditions, languages, and artistic expressions such as marimba music and hand-woven textiles. Daily life is anchored by strong family ties and deeply rooted religious faith, often seen in syncretic festivals like Inti Raymi or the Mama Negra, which merge Catholic beliefs with ancestral rituals. This cultural diversity is further reflected in a rich culinary tradition that varies from the highlands' hearty potato-based dishes like locro to the coast's fresh seafood favorites such as encebollado.</p>
